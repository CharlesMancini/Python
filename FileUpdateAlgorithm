#### ALGORITHM FOR FILE UPDATES IN PYTHON ####

#Open the file that contains the allow list:
#Use the open() function with the appropriate file mode ("r" for reading).
  with open("allow_list.txt", "r") as file:

#Read the file contents:
#Use the read() method to retrieve the content of the file as a string.
  allow_list_content = file.read()

#Convert the string into a list:
#Use the split() method to convert the string into a list of IP addresses.
  allow_list = allow_list_content.split()

#Iterate through the remove list:
#Use a for loop to iterate through each IP address in the remove list.
for ip_to_remove in remove_list:

#Remove IP addresses that are on the remove list:
#Use the remove() method to remove the specified IP address from the allow list.
if ip_to_remove in allow_list:
 allow_list.remove(ip_to_remove)

#Update the file with the revised list of IP addresses:
#Open the file again, this time with write mode ("w"), and write the modified list back to the file.
  with open("allow_list.txt", "w") as file:
 file.write(" ".join(allow_list))


#Provide a summary or conclusion of the algorithm, explaining that the file containing the allow list has been opened, its content read and converted into a list, 
unnecessary IP addresses removed based on the remove list, and the updated list written back to the file.

#Full Algorithm:
with open("allow_list.txt", "r") as file:
 allow_list_content = file.read()

allow_list = allow_list_content.split()

for ip_to_remove in remove_list:
 if ip_to_remove in allow_list:
 allow_list.remove(ip_to_remove)

with open("allow_list.txt", "w") as file:
 file.write(" ".join(allow_list))

# Summary:
# The file containing the allow list has been opened, its content read and converted into a list,
# unnecessary IP addresses removed based on the remove list, and the updated list written back to the file.
